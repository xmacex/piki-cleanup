A little project i'm working on during November-December 2012 to evaluate and help cleaning up the bibliographical database of PIKI-consortia. The consortia is made up of about 25 public libraries in Tampere region, and serves about 300 000 citizens and has about 2.5 million MARC21 records. Axiell Aurora ILS and Axiell Arena discovery interface (read: website).

This toolkit (lol) is not meant to be sustainable or even maintainable, to be honest, let's see... Project management lives elsewhere, at http://projektit.kirjastot.fi/projects/pikisiivous/

Comments welcome of course.
